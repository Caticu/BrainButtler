# BrainButtler
The app would be based mainly on tools for handling low executive functioning for neuro divergents people or just people who  struggle with their executive functions. There are 9-11 executive functions as in time management, memory, etc. For each executive function there will be tools at their disposal to handle each executive function. Much like a butler for the brain. A sort of external helper to your missing inner helper
The tools will be in the realm of mind maps to predict situations/tasks with unforeseen consequences that could cause stress or result in lack of completion
Another tool will be a memory help. Where you can submit what you need to remember, and the app will remind you for a set interval of time. And again, will function 
as a well-functioning memory but externally in your hand in the form of an app. It will also have a setting that will remind you in the form of notification if there 
is anything you might have forgotten or need to remember 
Another tool will be a fill out form of hows, whys, and where etc. for situations or task you need to get to or do. So, you have an appointment, and you’ll get a 
sense of overview, comfort and confidence for the situation you’re about to enter. 
Daily schedule with check boxes to stay organized and aware of your life. Maybe a reminder to a set time to fill out your schedule for the next day. 
Maybe also a food schedule for what you need to eat the following day and which groceries you’ll need.
There are neuro-divergent persons in my life who struggle with tasks that appear simple to someone with a conventional neurological profile. I wish to assist them in 
carrying out daily tasks, engaging in social interactions, etc. I have an idea of how I can help them now that I've had a "interview" with one individual matching that
kind of neurological profile and have done some internet research.
I have way more ideas on how to help them but now, 25/09/2022, I have these user stories for one part of the app.
1.	As a user, I want to be able to create an account, so that I can use the application.
2.	As a user, I want to be able to add an event with a title, so that I can prepare myself for that specific event.
3.	As a user, I want to add a date and time for an event so that the app notifies me when a specific thing is going to happen.
4.	As a user, I want to select how many times I want to be reminded about an upcoming event, so that I am not getting spammed or forget about it.
5.	As a user, I want to be asked a set of questions before finishing to create the event in case obstacles appear, so that I can write answers to myself to help me later.( When is it? Where is it? How will you get there? How will you have access to it? Which obstacles could occur? Possible problems?)
6.	As a user, I want to see a countdown of time left till the event is happening, so that I know how much time I have left.
